    <h3>How it waas using Diff to compare files?</h3>
    <p>
      - I am using  Windows PC and I used the FC command to compare two files with some small
      differences. It was really enlightening how fast one can be able tto debug a problem
      without spending so much time. It was simple and straight forward. Hopefully willing to
      use this amazing strategy again.

     <h3>How accessing the entire history make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?</h3>
     <p>
       - Having access to your file history can help you restore your programs to any point
       in time. You ca n try new code and not have to worry about saving a separate copy of the
       old one. You can keep track of the growth off you file and maybe learn from previous 
       attempts and mistakes.

     <h3>Pros and Cons of manually choosing to create a commit (Git) vs automatically saving (Google
     Docs)</h3>
    <p>
      Pros:
      - You have an option to save a commit code that makes logical sense
      - You can leave a short description of the commit you made to help understand the commit history
      - You have control over the file history, not too much files will be saved
      Cons:
      - You can forget to save a commit.
      - You may take long to have code that makes logical sense.
      - Takes practice to write meaningful descriptions of commits.
     </p>

    <h3>Why some version controls (Git) allow saving multiple files in one commit while others like
    Google Docs, treat each file separately?</h3>
    <p>
     - It is very common to have more that one related file in a repository. If one file changes
      then related changes to other files to compensate for that change can be made, hence 
      comparison accross multiple files can be done even under one commit because it will be 
      one feature that would have been added e.g. adding a a form, it will need HTML elements, 
      CSS styles for the layout and coloring and JS for posting the form.
     </p>


     <h3> How using version control make you confident to make changes that could break something?</h3>
    <p>
      - You can use *git diff fileId1 fileId2* command to compare different commit IDs until you find which commit 
      broke your code or which change broke your code. You can now return to the file or commit 
      where the problem did not exist by using *git checkout fileId*, where the fileId in this case is the 
      commit that you want to go back to.This allows you to move forward and back in time in your 
      project. Using checkout will restore all related files in that project to the specified version 
      of the commit.
    </p>


     <h3> What I want to use Git for?</h3>
      <p>- Have control over my projects. Being able to try out new concepts and ideas without worrying about not 
         being able to rtain a working state of the project. Also want to use git to control all changes that 
         happen to my projects. Git is a very nice and cool skill to have, haha.
